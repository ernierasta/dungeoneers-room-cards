5
Just another long-stretched corridor.  Better hurry on forward!
2 No special rules.
6
There are gratings in the floor throughout this corridor. By the look of it, the metal has seen better days and are very rusty. The first step makes the metal grind and make a tormented sound. The sound echoing through the corridor is bound attract some attention.
2
If the party enters the corridor, raise the threat level by 1. At the end of the turn, roll 1d10. If it ends up 1, the gratings give way, and one random hero must pass a DEX test (applying sixth sense if the hero has that talent) or fall down into the pit below. The hero takes 1d10 damage, without Armour but with NA. To get up, the party can either use a rope, or the hero must past a DEX test. It will take a full turn either way.

This dank corridor seems to end in two doorways, each lit by a torch in the wall.

The noise done will raise the threat level by 1 each turn.

2
Place 4 stacks of boxes and 2 barrels in the room. The stacks can each be individually searched.
3
*The Alchemist Chamber*\nThere is a foul odour in this chamber that must be emanating from one of the countless bottles and jars with alchemical ingredients.

2 The table and chest can be searched.
4
*The Library*\nIt feels like the air has been still in this room for a very long time. Dust is covering all the shelves and the hundreds of books in this room.

There are several contraptions in this room, cleverly designed to cause as much pain as possible to the ones unfortunate enough to be brought here.

In one corner, there is small chest, maybe containing the belongings of some victim.

7
*The Guards chamber*\nThis dimly lit chamber appears to be some kind of barrack. The fact that there are torches burning indicates that whoever sleeps here cannot be far away.

*Monster Den*\nAs soon as the party opens the door, they realize that this room is different. The smell of excrements is overwhelming, and there are no sources of light.  Carefully setting one foot inside the room, you hear the crunching sound of bones under your foot. The floor is littered in bones. It dawns on you that something non-human lives in here. However, gleaming in one corner is what seems to be a pile of gold.
2
Roll on the table to decide what monster lives here.  There is also an +10% increased chance of encounters, in which case the monster will appear instead of using the standard tables:*1:* Common troll, Armour 2; *2:* A Minotaur, Greataxe,Armour 2;*3:* A Gigantic snake; *4-6:* A Gigantic spider\NThe pile can be searched.

*Small treasure chamber*\nFinally, a room worthy of your presence. Even though the stones are as dank and dark as the rest of dungeon, there is a silver lining here. Alongside the walls are several chests just waiting to be plundered.
1
There are 3 chests in this room, of one is considered an objective chest.
10
*The Sanctuary*\nThere is a silence in this room that somehow feels reassuring. The room is dimly lit and in the middle of the room is a large fountain. The water from the fountain mirrors the torches, making the light dance across the ceiling and walls.
2
The water in the fountain can be drunk. Furthermore, it can be searched. The threat level is decreased by 2.

*Large dining hall*\nThe party enters a large hall that appears to be some kind of dining hall. There are several tables with chairs placed in the room, and in one corner is a large fireplace.

2
There are 3 tables in the room.  They are considered dining tables for searching purposes.  The mannequins may also be searched.
5
*The Pit*\nJust inside the door is a steep ledge. Carefully peeking over the edge, you see a pit so deep that cannot see the bottom.  You drop a small pebble down the chams and wait for the sound of it hitting the bottom, but after a minute of waiting, there is still no sound. Luckily, there is a rickety bridge going across to the other side and the door you've seen.
2
Fighting on the bridge is treacherous. Any hero reduced to 0 hit points must make a DEX roll. A failure will send the hero over the edge, plummeting to his death.
