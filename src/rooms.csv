,6,Spades.svg,"There are gratings in the floor throughout this corridor. By the look of it, the metal has seen better days and are very rusty. The first step makes the metal grind and make a tormented sound. The sound echoing through the corridor is bound attract some attention.","If the party enters the corridor, raise the threat level by 1. At the end of the turn, roll 1d10. If it ends up 1, the gratings give way, and one random hero must pass a DEX test (applying sixth sense if the hero has that talent) or fall down into the pit below. The hero takes 1d10 damage, without Armour but with NA. To get up, the party can either use a rope, or the hero must past a DEX test. It will take a full turn either way.",2,6x2.png,y,@roomback

,10,Spades.svg,"The party suddenly halts as they discover that the floor has given way in the middle of the corridor. Where the floor should be, there is now a large gaping hole of unknown depth.","The party can decide to jump across the chasm, passing and DEX+10 test. If a hero fails, he will fall into the chasm.  See Clover 3 for rules.",2,6x2.png,y,@roomback

,4,Clover.svg,"The corridor makes a sharp turn. In the corner, up against the wall sits a dead adventurer. By the look of it, he or she must have been there for a while since most of the flesh has been eaten away by god knows what.",The adventurer may be searched.,2,4x4-L.png,y,@roomback

,7,Clover.svg,The corridor in front of you has collapsed and there is no way you can get through without digging through the debris.,"Roll a 1d00. This is the number of stones that must be removed. Each player can remove their STR∕10 RDU number of stones during a full turn. A dwarf, being used to the labours in the mines, can remove STR∕5 RDU. Any character equipped with a pickaxe can remove twice his amour per turn. The noise done will raise the threat level by 1 each turn.",2,4x2.png,y,@roomback

,4,Hearts.svg,"*The Library*\nIt feels like the air has been still in this room for a very long time. Dust is covering all the shelves and the hundreds of books in this room.

However, gleaming in one corner is what seems to be a pile of gold.","Roll on the table to decide what monster lives here.
